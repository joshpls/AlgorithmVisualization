# AlgorithmVisualization
Visualization for the following algorithms: A* Search, Bredth First Search, Depth First Search, and Greedy-Best First Search.
In addition to Recursive and DFS maze generation.

# Features:
 - 4 Different Path finding Algorithms visualized
 - Maze Creation (recursive and DFS)
 - Time it takes to find path to goal
 - Total path from start to goal
 - Place start, finish, and create obstacles
 - Diagonal Path Finding
 - Show Steps
 - Grow and Shrink the maze (with + and - keys)

# A* Search: Weighted and gaurentee's the shortest path

# Bredth First Search: Unweighted and gaurentee's the shortest path
